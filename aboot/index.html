I’m a machine learning engineer with 5&#43; years of experience building predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI-powered apps on top of complex, gigabyte-scale datasets.
In my last role, I was on the AI Research team at Morning Consult, building ML/AI tools and features at scale for a global polling and survey data platform that powered everything from leading U.S. election trackers to seven-figure Fortune 500 marketing campaigns. Before that, I worked at an early-stage startup developing integrated automation solutions for biologists, and as a research assistant at the UChicago Energy &amp; Environment Lab, where I developed ML models and data pipelines for environmental policy research with the U.S. EPA, California Air Resources Board, and other governmental partners.">
